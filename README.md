## Project description

## Interactive API documentation
With the help of [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), an interactive API documentation
is available at `<host>:<port>/swagger-ui.html#/user-controller`. You can view
all available endpoints, what they do, their return types and parameters.

By clicking the _Try it out_ button in the upper right-hand corner of each endpoint
you can construct your own request and execute it again the server. You can then view
the actual response below.
